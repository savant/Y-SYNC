https://socket.io/get-started/chat
socket io - library that wraps around web socket technology | enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server

- web socket: on-going tcp connection between the client & server  
- bidirectional data flow
- server can push information rather than client having to request it every time. 


add socket.io to frontend js
npm install socket.io-client --save
